This exercises my mental space on the use of git for future collaboration with other software engineers.
the project is neccesary for the advancement of my git skills.
You can only participate if you are in cohort 10 in the AXL program.
You can also follow me here for more projects soon to be initiated.
Anyone can be a part of my projects, but not yet sha. when my hands don strong :).
